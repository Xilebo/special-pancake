# special-pancake
A meta framework for php-based websites

This is still work in progress!

## Slim through modularisation
Most frameworks often are complex packages which offer a lot of functionality - 
if you need it or not. Special-pancake tries to be as slim as possible, by
moving as much functionality to modules/plugins as possible and by making it as
optional as possible.  
This way you have to think a little more about, what you actually need, but you
also have a much slimmer and thus often faster software.

## Compatibility
Special-pancake relies on php only everything else is optional. This is to be
compatible with as many environments as possible.
